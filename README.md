Network Traffic Monitoring Project

This project is designed to monitor network traffic using NestJS and C++. It connects a C++ application via a TCP socket to transmit network data to the NestJS backend. The system includes user (IP) management and log monitoring functionality.
Project Overview

    Backend: The backend is built with NestJS, where network data is processed and exposed to clients. The data is received from a C++ application via a TCP socket.
    C++ Application: The C++ application collects network traffic data and sends it to the NestJS backend over a TCP connection.
    User Management: The system allows the registration of users by their IP addresses, and logs can be tracked for each user.
    Security Considerations: While ARP spoofing was initially considered for deeper network control, a simpler approach was chosen for security reasons.
    Migration: The project is currently being migrated to a C++ desktop application for improved performance and efficiency 

How it Works

    C++ Application: The C++ application collects network data and connects to the NestJS backend via a TCP socket.
    NestJS Backend: NestJS receives the data from the C++ application and processes it according to business logic (user/IP registration, log monitoring).
    User/IP Management: Users are registered based on their IP addresses, allowing for targeted log tracking.
    Log Monitoring: Logs are monitored and stored for analysis and tracking per user.

Installation



cd network-monitoring-project

Install dependencies:

npm install

Run the application:
    
    g++ ./c++/websocket/websocket.c++ -o network 
    
    sudo ./network
    
    yarn dev || npm run dev

Migration to C++ Desktop Application


  

Currently, the project is being migrated to a C++ desktop application to improve performance and efficiency. The desktop version will integrate more directly with the operating systemâ€™s network interfaces and allow for greater control over network traffic monitoring.
